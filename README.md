# What is this?
This is a knowledge system helping prevention workers to perform a risk
inventory. Based on the user's answers to several questions, it categorizes the
building that the user is concerned with and creates a checklist of possible
risks that could be of concern.
The system includes the possiblity to use your own xml-knowledge base (to change
the questions, inferences and checklists), a way to download the
created checklist and a graphical user interface that makes it easy to use for
users with little computer experience.

The system is built for the course "Knowledge Technology Practical".

# Important Notice
Be wary that the suggestions of this system should only be used as a rough
guideline. They are in no way guaranteed to be in accord with the law.

# Acknowledgements
This knowledge system is based on
[this project](https://github.com/jelmervdl/kennissysteem), whose author gave us
the permission to use his work. Most credit for the implementation of the actual
inference mechanism, including the possibility to encode knowledge in XML files,
goes to him. Take a look at his work!
