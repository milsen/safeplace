**This is a work in progress. The development has barely begun.**

# What is this?
This is a knowledge system giving advice for the design of buildings. It is
based on the regulations for the safety of buildings in the Netherlands and
includes a graphical user interface that makes it easy to use for users with
little computer experience.

The system is built for the course "Knowledge Technology Practical".

# Important Notice
Be wary that the suggestions of this system should only be used as a rough
guideline. They are in no way guaranteed to be in accord with the law.

# Acknowledgements
This knowledge system is based on
[this project](https://github.com/jelmervdl/kennissysteem), whose author gave us
the permission to use his work. All credit for the implementation of the actual
inference mechanism, including the possibility to encode knowledge in XML files,
goes to him. Take a look at his work!
